BlockStuff is a comprehensive Magisk module designed to enhance productivity by blocking advertisements, excluding focus-draining content, and eliminating time-wasting distractions. It just blocks stuff that isn't worth your valuable time, attention, and compute.

It is primarily made by me for me. But if you see a benefit for yourself, feel free to give this project a star.
